Ahead, two shapes stand among the twisting crystal roots; a distended soft of light that will have been Tau, and a cloaked figure, radiating an all-too-familiar nothing. A distorted Seeker, a walker of The Sightless Way... but one unusually rich in form, standing by with their tattered blindfold fluttering in the psychic breeze. Bearer approaches the odd pair with a measured caution, but their tension eases as the faint echo of the softened chime drowns out the roar of the dull static that pervades every corner of the Cosmic Wood. 'The utensil arrives,' The Seeker does not turn, but speaks sharply into Bearer's mind. A disquieting feeling for a brief moment, as the familiar sting of mental sundering does not arrive. '...you, to prune the fate-rhizome and free our girl.' Aoyg-No-Longer chants, wielding a different weapon, a much older one. Bearer halts a few steps away, their muscles tensed again. Now the Seeker turns, as if to see, and slowly raises a gray hand to point. 'Go now and perform the motion.' Bearer shakes the feeling loose, and carefully works their way under the twisted taproots as their mechanical arms rotate backwards, to extract a large leather-wrapped bundle from among the waterskins and tools arrayed across their flanks. Gently setting it onto the ordered black soil, they detangle the silent crystal from its wrappings, taking a moment to glance again at the Seeker. Aoyg-No-Longer has not moved. The tauroid arconaut stands up slowly as their upper arms stow their belongings away, and takes a moment to stretch. Their curiosity gets the better of them. 'Where are you taking Tau?' their mind jabs out, a pointed question. 'Prune! The utensil prunes!' The warped figure's cowled head snaps to an acute angle, their blindfold drifting wide. 'But no, the utensil quivers in uncertainty and vibrates out a question?' Their head snaps back to regarding the softthing that will have been Tau. 'The self is riddled with category errors. The thinking brain mistakes formation for meaning.' After another brief pause awaiting further barbs, Bearer grunts quietly to themself and hefts the spined crystal into the soft, where it bobs and tilts gently in the light stream as the tones merge and the song reconstitutes. A note is plucked, beyond the staff and beyond the ear, and the echo gives way to a sudden deafening silence. A melodious chord rings out, edging into a minor key. 'Again I perceive.' sings Tau-no-Longer. She rotates slowly, as if testing her solidity. 'Thank you, rootclimber. Chavvah's rewards are great and you are deserving of them.' 'Tau - ' Bearer says, pausing to think, pursing their lips and glancing at the Seeker again. 'You would suborn your will to Ptoh?' The Seeker twitches reflexively at the mention of the name. Tau hums for a moment, as if considering the very shape of the question. 'Speaking creatures seem very engrossed in this 'will' idea, but few agree what it is. Your mind is under influence from other thinkbeings the moment you observe them, yes?' She turns sharply in a few ordinal directions, pulsing a deep blue. 'You 'learn' by imitating, your values and beliefs are adopted from observation. Yes?' Bearer's eyes scan across the pearlescent surface of the chime, seeking any understanding, but finding none. They shake their head, scattering digits across their mask's projection field. 'Learning from nothing is no different. You will have always been of something.' They stretch their four hands outwards in a square, then draw them back together. Tau-no-Longer responds sharply, tone more discordant now. 'I have made a choice to offer my consciousness to a new paradigm, but this choice seems distinct from your conception of 'will'. We speak past one another.' The rhinoceran's horned brow wrinkles, and they draw themselves back to their full height, sighing. 'That may be, Tau-no-Longer, but I speak. You yet do not.' They bow their horn deeply. 'May the Fates favor you.' The nothing chime pauses her motion momentarily, as if to absorb those last words. Then the curve accelerates again to blurring speed, and a glittering crescent spins off from her shining geometry and embeds itself in the gridded soil, disturbing the orderly patterns. 'I wish the same for you, Bearer. Before you go, take this, a piece of my bodystuff, as thanks for completing the -elseing.' Bearer stoops slowly to pick it up, gently placing it into their pack with care. Then they both intone in time, a chord high and a voice low: 'Live and drink.' Bearer turns to leave, and takes a few steps before slowing to a stop, their packs and artifacts swaying in the unlight. They turn one more time to Aoyg-no-Longer. 'Tell me what you offer. I wish to understand.' The Seeker does not respond, but turns and slowly draws their silvery arms wide, a bitter parody of Bearer's gesture. The rippling of their cowl jostles the blindfold aside for only a moment, leaving only the afterimage of empty eyes, vantabud-black. Then their voice cuts into the mind, clearer now. 'Maggot! What do you think words are? Arrows of inquiry?' Their arms fall limply to their sides. 'Words are bricks. Each spoken is laid in bond and builds your prison. There is no understanding.' Bearer responds aloud, a low rumble building in their throat.Â 'Mm. Bricks can be thrown, too.' Aoyg-no-Longer snaps back immediately. 'You tarry on the future's boundary with abandon, utensil.' They turn back to the now-silent chime, theatrically slowly. 'Throw your brick if you dare.' Bearer glances back at Tau-no-Longer, and jerks their chin upward, their gnarled horn spiking the air. 'The Seekers of the Sightless Way hunt espers.' they say, a mechanical hand tracing a blackened scar across their chestplate. 'Oh, yes?' the chime hums. 'I see. Well... do you... not hunt, Bearer? Or align with hunters?' The note pitches down. 'You reek of predation yourself. You kill, yes?' Her form adjusts, expanding slightly, the crystalline spines aligning into pointed shapes. 'I recall no promise to become a grazing hedonist. If I am called to hunt I will hunt.' Bearer looks down at the disturbed soil again, and grins sadly. 'Oh, solemn song of Tau-no-Longer, they will see that you hunt.' 'You- ' Aoyg-no-Longer interrupts again, still unmoving. ' -thrived at the performance of a pruning motion, utensil.' A keening edge creeps into their mental cant, as if barely resisting a violent reflex. 'Now store yourself until Fate reshapes you.' Their uneven fingers unfurl, their palm face-down. 'The end.' Bearer's grin hardens. 'Aye. So it is.' One weatherbeaten eye closes, the other snaps wide, icy-cold mist pouring forth from it like rapidly-sublimating tears. The distorted Seeker turns indignantly, as time flickers and strains. Eight faded figures now were always surrounding the pair of formers, a looming ring of bowing horns and gesturing hands and orbiting black motes, slowly resolving and withdrawing into the dancing petals. Each Bearer draws their four blades wide; the curve of the zetachrome refracts the unlight into black rainbows, the ceremonial vibroblade hums to life with a forgotten energy, the hardened Point of the Imor Coronal crackles a cold static animus, and the ancient sultanate crysteel shatters and reforms as cosmic ticks pass. Thirty-two blades together draw perfect circles in the air. Aoyg-no-Longer pivots on the spot, facing each Bearer in turn. 'A million sun-dead homes I've roved, a trillion more await.' Their sundering speech rings out with an edge like a sultan croc's teeth, sharp and firm with no semblance of fear. 'I'm a worm in the loam of a cosmic wood, perched on a cosmic gulf, swathed in the god-manifold.' The force behind it quickens to a black moon flame, an anger beyond all reason, lashing out at the circling shadows. 'And you?' Bearer does not respond, gritting their teeth against the scorching rage. One tick later, thirty-two blades have already struck as one. The Seeker blanks instantly, held aloft only by endings, their face cold and calm to the end. Only their blindfold moves, slipping away on the breeze, lost into the Wood. Then the waveform collapses, and the newly-christened Aoyg-That-Never-Was crumples like a broken waydroid into the dirt. Bearers become Bearer, and a pained silence creeps back in. A plaintive chime rings. 'You have severed the hand outstretched to me. Why?' The chord warbles, uneven. 'What have you done? What am I to do?' Bearer takes a deep breath, watching the hexagonal crystals already encroaching on the unspacely form that stains the soil, filing its atoms away along the psychic veins to be better organized. They speak quietly, out of some reflexive solemnity. 'Your will would be suborned to Ptoh.' A pounding forte howls back. 'You suborn my will! You allow me to start upon this path and block it. Yes?' 'No.' Bearer responds, shaking their scarred head. 'You requested that I not subvert your will. Even if you do not know what will is, yet. I upheld that request. No one who is, or is not, will subvert it. It is yours alone, now.' Bearer adjusts their packs again and gazes upwards, considering the ascent. 'This is what it is to be -else, Tau-no-Longer.' The chime quiets slowly, to the lightest piano. 'Now I am truly adrift.' There is silence again, and the hum of the dull static begins to creep in among the deep roots, with no song to keep it at bay. Bearer speaks again. 'You will be happier this way. You will Be and will have Been.' The chime thrums quietly, a tune that resonates through Bearer like a song from a half-remembered dream. 'Perhaps.' she begins, and a few more notes ring out in turn, testing the echoes that return. 'My future is hazy. My future twists in the chill wind of the Gyre. I can have no faith in your vision.' 'You understand this, yes?' Tau-no-Longer sings to a coda, finally considering the sounds around her for the first time. 'I believe I do not wish to know you. Live and drink.' Bearer nods solemnly, and turns to leave. As they trot away, they raise a hand. 'Live and drink, Tau-no-Longer. You are Sightless still, so go forth and do not See.' Their wings snap wide with a crack and they alight, scattering the fractal petals again, and they are gone among the mirrors and spines of the Moon Stair."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/the-weight-of-a-thousand-suns/"><meta property="og:title" content="The Weight of a Thousand Suns"><meta property="og:image" content="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/suns.png"><meta property="og:image:width" content="1680"><meta property="og:image:height" content="2376"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Hangedman Design"><meta property="og:description" content="Bearer descends through a gap in the firmament, wings outstretched, and land with a gentle canter in the glittering field, scattering petals into the air.

Bearer nods solemnly, and turns to leave. As they trot away, they raise a hand. 'Live and drink, Tau-no-Longer. You are Sightless still, so go forth and do not See.' Their wings snap wide with a crack and they alight, scattering the fractal petals again, and they are gone among the mirrors and spines of the Moon Stair.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hangedman","url":"https://www.hangedmandesign.com/authors/hangedman/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Hangedman","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/website/hangedlogovec-2.svg","height":58,"width":38}}}</script></head><body><div class="container js-container"><nav class="menu"><ul class="navbar__menu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>QA</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/chicory-a-colorful-tale/" target="_self">Chicory: A Colorful Tale</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/i-was-a-teenage-exocolonist/" target="_self">I Was A Teenage Exocolonist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/tunic/" target="_self">TUNIC</a></li></ul></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>GAME DESIGN</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/gemeton-and-gemeton-arcade/" target="_self">Gemeton (and Gemeton Arcade)</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/merrow/" target="_self">Merrow</a><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/merrow-postmortem-patches/" target="_self">Merrow Dev: Patches</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/miscellaneous-games/" target="_self">Miscellaneous: Games</a></li></ul></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>WRITING</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/neotokyo-manual/" target="_self">NEOTOKYOÂ° Manual</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/technical-writing/" target="_self">Technical Writing</a></li></ul></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>VISUAL DESIGN</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/famicase/" target="_self">Famicase</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/mute/" target="_self">Mute City</a></li></ul></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>COMMUNITY</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/dirty-rectangles/" target="_self">Dirty Rectangles</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/sustainable-game-dev-communities/" target="_self">Sustainable Game Dev Communities</a></li></ul></li><li><span></span></li><li class="has-submenu"><span>CONTACT/LINKS</span><ul class="navbar__submenu"><li><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/contact/" target="_self">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://dirty-rectangles.com" target="_self">Dirty Rectangles (website)</a></li><li><a href="https://hangedman.itch.io" target="_blank">Itch.io (Game projects)</a></li><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/hangedman" target="_blank">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/JonahD" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hangedman.bsky.social" target="_blank">Bluesky</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><div class="content"><header class="top"><div class="top__item"><a class="logo" href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/"><img src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/website/hangedlogovec-2.svg" alt="Hangedman Design"></a></div><div class="top__item top__item--right"><button class="menu-toggle js-menu-toggle" aria-label="Menu" aria-expanded="false"><span class="menu-toggle-box"><span class="menu-toggle-inner">Menu</span></span></button></div></header><main class="main"><article class="post"><div class="main__left"><figure class="hero"><img src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/suns.png" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-xs.png 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-sm.png 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-md.png 768w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-lg.png 1024w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-xl.png 1280w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/33/responsive/suns-2xl.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" loading="eager" height="2376" width="1680" alt=""></figure><header><h1>The Weight of a Thousand Suns</h1></header></div><div class="main__right"><div class="post__entry"><p>Bearer descends through a gap in the firmament, wings outstretched, and land with a gentle canter in the glittering field, scattering petals into the air.Â <br><br>Ahead, two shapes stand among the twisting crystal roots; a distended soft of light that will have been Tau, and a cloaked figure, radiating an all-too-familiar nothing. A distorted Seeker, a walker of The Sightless Way... but one unusually rich in form, standing by with their tattered blindfold fluttering in the psychic breeze.</p><p>Bearer approaches the odd pair with a measured caution, but their tension eases as the faint echo of the softened chime drowns out the roar of the dull static that pervades every corner of the Cosmic Wood.Â <br><br>"The utensil arrives," The Seeker does not turn, but speaks sharply into Bearer's mind. A disquieting feeling for a brief moment, as the familiar sting of mental sundering does not arrive. "...you, to prune the fate-rhizome and free our girl." Aoyg-No-Longer chants, wielding a different weapon, a much older one.<br><br>Bearer halts a few steps away, their muscles tensed again. Now the Seeker turns, as if to see, and slowly raises a gray hand to point. "Go now and perform the motion."<br><br>Bearer shakes the feeling loose, and carefully works their way under the twisted taproots as their mechanical arms rotate backwards, to extract a large leather-wrapped bundle from among the waterskins and tools arrayed across their flanks.</p><p>Gently setting it onto the ordered black soil, they detangle the silent crystal from its wrappings, taking a moment to glance again at the Seeker. Aoyg-No-Longer has not moved.Â <br><br>The tauroid arconaut stands up slowly as their upper arms stow their belongings away, and takes a moment to stretch. Their curiosity gets the better of them.Â <br><br>"Where are you taking Tau?" their mind jabs out, a pointed question.Â <br><br>"Prune! The utensil prunes!" The warped figure's cowled head snaps to an acute angle, their blindfold drifting wide. "But no, the utensil quivers in uncertainty and vibrates out a question?"Â </p><p>Their head snaps back to regarding the softthing that will have been Tau. "The self is riddled with category errors. The thinking brain mistakes formation for meaning."<br><br>After another brief pause awaiting further barbs, Bearer grunts quietly to themself and hefts the spined crystal into the soft, where it bobs and tilts gently in the light stream as the tones merge and the song reconstitutes.</p><p>A note is plucked, beyond the staff and beyond the ear, and the echo gives way to a sudden deafening silence. A melodious chord rings out, edging into a minor key.<br><br>"Again I perceive." sings Tau-no-Longer. She rotates slowly, as if testing her solidity. "Thank you, rootclimber. Chavvah's rewards are great and you are deserving of them."Â <br><br>"Tau - " Bearer says, pausing to think, pursing their lips and glancing at the Seeker again. "You would suborn your will to Ptoh?"</p><p>The Seeker twitches reflexively at the mention of the name. Tau hums for a moment, as if considering the very shape of the question.<br><br>"Speaking creatures seem very engrossed in this 'will' idea, but few agree what it is. Your mind is under influence from other thinkbeings the moment you observe them, yes?" She turns sharply in a few ordinal directions, pulsing a deep blue. "You 'learn' by imitating, your values and beliefs are adopted from observation. Yes?"<br><br>Bearer's eyes scan across the pearlescent surface of the chime, seeking any understanding, but finding none. They shake their head, scattering digits across their mask's projection field. "Learning from nothing is no different. You will have always been of something." They stretch their four hands outwards in a square, then draw them back together.<br><br>Tau-no-Longer responds sharply, tone more discordant now. "I have made a choice to offer my consciousness to a new paradigm, but this choice seems distinct from your conception of 'will'. We speak past one another."<br><br>The rhinoceran's horned brow wrinkles, and they draw themselves back to their full height, sighing. "That may be, Tau-no-Longer, but I speak. You yet do not." They bow their horn deeply. "May the Fates favor you."<br><br>The nothing chime pauses her motion momentarily, as if to absorb those last words. Then the curve accelerates again to blurring speed, and a glittering crescent spins off from her shining geometry and embeds itself in the gridded soil, disturbing the orderly patterns.<br>"I wish the same for you, Bearer. Before you go, take this, a piece of my bodystuff, as thanks for completing the -elseing."<br><br>Bearer stoops slowly to pick it up, gently placing it into their pack with care. Then they both intone in time, a chord high and a voice low: "Live and drink."<br><br>Bearer turns to leave, and takes a few steps before slowing to a stop, their packs and artifacts swaying in the unlight. They turn one more time to Aoyg-no-Longer.</p><p>"Tell me what you offer. I wish to understand."<br><br>The Seeker does not respond, but turns and slowly draws their silvery arms wide, a bitter parody of Bearer's gesture. The rippling of their cowl jostles the blindfold aside for only a moment, leaving only the afterimage of empty eyes, vantabud-black. Then their voice cuts into the mind, clearer now. "Maggot! What do you think words are? Arrows of inquiry?"</p><p>Their arms fall limply to their sides. "Words are bricks. Each spoken is laid in bond and builds your prison. There is no understanding."<br><br>Bearer responds aloud, a low rumble building in their throat.Â "Mm. Bricks can be thrown, too."Â <br><br>Aoyg-no-Longer snaps back immediately. "You tarry on the future's boundary with abandon, utensil." They turn back to the now-silent chime, theatrically slowly. "Throw your brick if you dare."<br><br>Bearer glances back at Tau-no-Longer, and jerks their chin upward, their gnarled horn spiking the air. "The Seekers of the Sightless Way hunt espers." they say, a mechanical hand tracing a blackened scar across their chestplate.<br><br>"Oh, yes?" the chime hums. "I see. Well... do you... not hunt, Bearer? Or align with hunters?"Â </p><p>The note pitches down. "You reek of predation yourself. You kill, yes?" Her form adjusts, expanding slightly, the crystalline spines aligning into pointed shapes. "I recall no promise to become a grazing hedonist. If I am called to hunt I will hunt."<br><br>Bearer looks down at the disturbed soil again, and grins sadly. "Oh, solemn song of Tau-no-Longer, they will see that you hunt."<br><br>"You- " Aoyg-no-Longer interrupts again, still unmoving. " -thrived at the performance of a pruning motion, utensil." A keening edge creeps into their mental cant, as if barely resisting a violent reflex.</p><p>"Now store yourself until Fate reshapes you." Their uneven fingers unfurl, their palm face-down. "The end."<br><br>Bearer's grin hardens. "Aye. So it is."<br><br>One weatherbeaten eye closes, the other snaps wide, icy-cold mist pouring forth from it like rapidly-sublimating tears. The distorted Seeker turns indignantly, as time flickers and strains.<br><br>Eight faded figures now were always surrounding the pair of formers, a looming ring of bowing horns and gesturing hands and orbiting black motes, slowly resolving and withdrawing into the dancing petals.<br><br>Each Bearer draws their four blades wide; the curve of the zetachrome refracts the unlight into black rainbows, the ceremonial vibroblade hums to life with a forgotten energy, the hardened Point of the Imor Coronal crackles a cold static animus, and the ancient sultanate crysteel shatters and reforms as cosmic ticks pass.</p><p>Thirty-two blades together draw perfect circles in the air.<br><br>Aoyg-no-Longer pivots on the spot, facing each Bearer in turn. "A million sun-dead homes I've roved, a trillion more await." Their sundering speech rings out with an edge like a sultan croc's teeth, sharp and firm with no semblance of fear. "I'm a worm in the loam of a cosmic wood, perched on a cosmic gulf, swathed in the god-manifold."</p><p>The force behind it quickens to a black moon flame, an anger beyond all reason, lashing out at the circling shadows. "And you?"<br><br>Bearer does not respond, gritting their teeth against the scorching rage. One tick later, thirty-two blades have already struck as one.<br><br>The Seeker blanks instantly, held aloft only by endings, their face cold and calm to the end. Only their blindfold moves, slipping away on the breeze, lost into the Wood.</p><p>Then the waveform collapses, and the newly-christened Aoyg-That-Never-Was crumples like a broken waydroid into the dirt. Bearers become Bearer, and a pained silence creeps back in.Â <br><br>A plaintive chime rings. "You have severed the hand outstretched to me. Why?"</p><p>The chord warbles, uneven. "What have you done? What am I to do?"<br><br>Bearer takes a deep breath, watching the hexagonal crystals already encroaching on the unspacely form that stains the soil, filing its atoms away along the psychic veins to be better organized. They speak quietly, out of some reflexive solemnity. "Your will would be suborned to Ptoh."<br><br>A pounding forte howls back. "You suborn my will! You allow me to start upon this path and block it. Yes?"<br><br>"No." Bearer responds, shaking their scarred head. "You requested that I not subvert your will. Even if you do not know what will is, yet. I upheld that request. No one who is, or is not, will subvert it. It is yours alone, now."Â <br><br>Bearer adjusts their packs again and gazes upwards, considering the ascent. "This is what it is to be -else, Tau-no-Longer."</p><p>The chime quiets slowly, to the lightest piano. "Now I am truly adrift."<br><br>There is silence again, and the hum of the dull static begins to creep in among the deep roots, with no song to keep it at bay. Bearer speaks again. "You will be happier this way. You will Be and will have Been."<br><br>The chime thrums quietly, a tune that resonates through Bearer like a song from a half-remembered dream.</p><p>"Perhaps." she begins, and a few more notes ring out in turn, testing the echoes that return. "My future is hazy. My future twists in the chill wind of the Gyre. I can have no faith in your vision."</p><p>"You understand this, yes?" Tau-no-Longer sings to a coda, finally considering the sounds around her for the first time. "I believe I do not wish to know you. Live and drink."Â <br><br>Bearer nods solemnly, and turns to leave. As they trot away, they raise a hand.<br>"Live and drink, Tau-no-Longer. You are Sightless still, so go forth and do not See."<br><br>Their wings snap wide with a crack and they alight, scattering the fractal petals again, and they are gone among the mirrors and spines of the Moon Stair.</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Content Â© Hangedman Design.
