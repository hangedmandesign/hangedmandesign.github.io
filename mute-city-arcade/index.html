So I set about building my own cabinet.</p><h2>Materials</h2><p>I can't offer you a proper bill of materials because this wasn't an orderly project, and it was a couple months of very-part-time work and endless iteration. What I can tell you is that the total cost of materials, including all technology inside except whatever runs the games, was around $250 maximum, likely less.</p><p>Here's what I used:</p><ul><li>5~6kg of SUNLU PETG White filament</li><li>Small amounts of other white and translucent PET and PETG filament</li><li>DELL 2007FPb 4:3 LCD I got for $20 at a thrift store</li><li>Logitech desktop speakers I got for $15 at the same store</li><li>Brook Universal Fighting Board, Brook arcade wiring harness</li><li>SANWA JLF arcade stick and buttons from a broken stick</li><li>A 4-pack of cheap 80mm PC fans</li><li>A cheap 4-port USB Hub</li><li>A cheap Power+USB surge protector with many ports</li><li>A cheap customizable LED light strip</li><li>Pliers, wrenches, IFIXIT screwdrivers, God Hand and tin snips</li><li>Assorted bolts, nuts, wingnuts, threaded screw rods</li><li>Super glue (gel), zipties</li><li>Enamel primer and gloss spray paint</li><li>The help of a friend who works at a print shop</li></ul><p>I started with the understanding that I wanted to be able to drop any old piece of tech into the cab to play the games, and have most of the functionality I needed work via USB. That also meant the video could be any monitor that supported HDMI, which is much better these days with upscalers being readily available. I didn't want to worry about supporting JAMMA or other old arcade hardware. </p><h2>Design</h2><p>I started out with one premise: tiny tabletop arcade cabinets (like the Astro City Mini) are very neat little pieces of tech, but they are too small to use comfortably, especially for adults. So I wasn't going to build one unless it was scaled properly for sustained use by adults.</p><p>While considering how to go about printing a cabinet, I came across the excellent "<a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/mini-new-astro-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini New Astro City</a>" free 3D-printable model STL files made by Game-Makers. The MNAC design was very well-made, and importantly, was not pre-separated into many small parts since it was intended to be printed as larger pieces on a larger print bed (300mm³ vs my printer's 256mm³).</p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/img09.JPG" alt="" width="1280" height="720" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/img09-xs.JPG 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/img09-sm.JPG 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/img09-md.JPG 768w"></figure><figcaption>The Game-Makers "Mini New Astro City" model, exploded diagram provided by Game-Makers.</figcaption></figure><p>I imported the MNAC files into Bambu Studio and arranged them as in the real unit to get a sense of the print size. I also measured the dimensions of the potential 4:3 and 16:9 LCD displays I had, to get an idea of how wide the scaled-up cabinet would have to be to accommodate them, which came to exactly 400mm wide (measuring across the monitor enclosure, between the two sides).</p><p>In Bambu Studio you can use the Measure tool to measure between any two points on a model, get an accurate measurement, and then edit that measurement, causing everything selected to scale up by the same factor as the measured item. So I scaled up the entire arrangement to make that enclosure 400mm wide, and I had my base to work from.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/2026-02-15_15_13_12.png" alt="" width="1032" height="1110" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_13_12-xs.png 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_13_12-sm.png 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_13_12-md.png 768w"><figcaption>Using Bambu Studio's Measure tool to measure the MNAC monitor enclosure (pictured in green) was how I scaled the entire design. This example shows my updated body model, not the MNAC.</figcaption></figure><p>There were some immediate issues I had to address.</p><p>The MNAC design was intended to use a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, and still had the specific ports for attaching one, now scaled up to no longer fit a Pi. Similarly, the controller box top and front both now had holes that were larger than arcade buttons, and laid out incorrectly. To resolve these, I exported the main body as an OBJ 3D model, and imported it into Blender to edit it manually. I started by cleaning up and removing all the ports, replacing them with flat geometry.</p><p>It had occurred to me that if I used a standard port for all the openings, I could easily design attachments, covers, plugs, etc. And I knew I needed to incorporate fans into the design, so I designed a "negative" model that incorporated an opening for an 80mm stock computer case fan and its screws, arrayed them on the sides/back/bottom of the model, and used the Boolean modifier to subtract those models from the arcade body, leaving open spaces.</p><p>I also substantially simplified (or complicated) some details of the geometry and attachment points, assuming that the old screw sizing and other features wouldn't work. I was correct, although my planning wasn't ideal, though I wouldn't realize that until later.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/2025-08-07-BodyV2_16667e.png" alt="" width="1278" height="1245" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2025-08-07-BodyV2_16667e-xs.png 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2025-08-07-BodyV2_16667e-sm.png 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2025-08-07-BodyV2_16667e-md.png 768w"><figcaption>The main body model, after Blender edits.</figcaption></figure><p>I then used Bambu Studio to cut this body model into four major pieces: two sides, upper back, and lower back with bottom, which were each then divided with further cuts into four pieces each.</p><p>When cutting those pieces, I used Bambu's ability to add connectors (posts and corresponding indents, dovetail joints, etc) in the parts, so they could snap together and be secured with nothing but glue. This had mixed results, especially in places I forgot to add posts early on during the process, but it was still very solid.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/2026-02-15_15_11_37.png" alt="" width="1588" height="1262" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_11_37-xs.png 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_11_37-sm.png 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_11_37-md.png 768w"><figcaption>Four chopped pieces of one side of the cabinet, with visible posts and negative "post" indents.</figcaption></figure><p>I would make similar edits and changes to the controller box and top later, once I had the main body model printed as a proof of concept. I did the same trick with Boolean modifiers, starting from a solid surface and "subtracting" the negative of a Vewlix control layout. This required some iteration as well, having to add posts to the underside of the controller box top, as the lack of supports made it worryingly flexible when buttons were pressed.</p><p>Many of the remaining MNAC model pieces, I was able to use with no changes beyond scaling up and adding supports/joints/attachments.</p><p>Essentially all the models had to be cut into pieces to fit on the print bed. Fortunately, most fit almost exactly as two pieces, such as the controller box pictured below.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/2026-02-15_15_14_22.png" alt="" width="1825" height="1261" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_14_22-xs.png 300w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_14_22-sm.png 480w, https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/responsive/2026-02-15_15_14_22-md.png 768w"><figcaption>Various parts of the cabinet, chopped and separated across print plates, with visible dovetail joints.</figcaption></figure><h2>Printing and Assembly</h2><p>I started with printing the sliced pieces of the main body model, and assembled them.</p><p>Almost immediately, poor choices of where to align my cuts and make my edits came back to haunt me, as these pieces assembled very easily but there were gaps in the body. </p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/mutecityarcade_2025-09-07_1_2.png" data-size="2142x2856"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/mutecityarcade_2025-09-07_1_2-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>The four pieces of one side, printed and assembled.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/IMG_6815.jpg" data-size="4284x5712"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/IMG_6815-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>Bottom and lower-back pieces, and monitor ridge.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/IMG_6826.jpg" data-size="4284x5712"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/media/posts/35/gallery/IMG_6826-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a><figcaption>Assembled body without upper back.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>You can see in the third image above that there are two front brackets that jut out slightly, which are where the controller box joins with the main body.
