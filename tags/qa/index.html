It featured audio by A Shell In The Pit (Untitled Goose Game, Rogue Legacy) along with a soundtrack comprised of many varied artists. It was published by Finji (Overland, Night In The Woods) and released on PC, Switch, and Sony platforms on August 25, 2022. Not long after TUNIC released, Finji immediately moved me into spearheading the final major QA pass for Exocolonist, my first project as a QA Lead. The game had already been heavily beta-tested by a dedicated and supportive community, so my goal was to work from that foundation and ensure that a game so focused on inclusivity and expression would be accessible and fun for everyone. My QA process focused very heavily on interaction and controls, overseeing a complete Gamepad implementation, refining UI navigation and comprehension (especially on small screens), and a continuous iterative process of tiny tweaks with outsize impacts. When a player's only methods of interaction with a game are simple, any flaws or frustrations will multiply very quickly, so the most basic interactions (clicking buttons, navigating lists of options, etc.) needed to be perfect. The game is a genre-spanning interactive story, very complex and deeply systematic, rigorously-designed to account for an absurd number of branching story events. It also deals with heavy topics in a very respectful way, but pulls no punches. It is very unique. I was able to offer some insights to Finji on how to meet the expectations of the various crossover audiences who might want to try the game: fans of visual novels, life simulations, colony simulations, character-driven role-playing games, digital card-puzzle games, and more. It's many games in one. Testing Exocolonist was very different than any project I've worked on before, and a very fulfilling challenge. I'm especially proud of the game immediately passing certification across all platforms, an achievement in itself and a testament to the QA team's immaculate work.

Featuring music by Lifeformed (Dustforce, Double Fine Adventure) and audio by Kevin Regamey (Powerup Audio), it was a multi-year project that was finally released on PC and Xbox platforms on March 2022. After my work on Chicory, I was brought on again to assist the excellent Finji QA team as primary PC QA for TUNIC. Our team was embedded alongside the development team, and helped bring the project to completion by ensuring the last few months of development ran smoothly, as well as being a fresh set of eyes on the game's mysteries: acting as advocates for future players. I spent several months testing and experimenting with the game, reporting bugs and issues, offering design and accessibility feedback, and doing my best to support the team on their final sprint to release. I continued to work with the team beyond launch, monitoring and tracking incoming issues; reporting, reproducing, and helping to resolve the complex issues that arose from a very complex game. Despite the complexity (stemming from the game's many secrets and open-world structure), the project's foundation was absolutely solid, and the development was well-planned and well-executed. Working with Finji's expanded QA team was an excellent supportive experience, and I would happily take any chance to collaborate with them again. I'm still enjoying watching others play the game and discover its mysteries. It was, and is, something incredible to have been a part of.

It was successfully Kickstarted and picked up by indie publisher Finji (Overland, Night In The Woods). It was released on PC, Mac, and PlayStation platforms in June 2021. It released on Nintendo Switch in December 2021. Finji contracted me to assist with QA, once the project was quite far along in production. What started as a short contract became me taking on the role of primary PC QA, working closely alongside the development team through release. Finji's internal QA team was focused on the PlayStation ports and console-specific complexities, so I was happy to offer my help. I spent several months testing and retesting the game extensively, reporting bugs/graphical/structural issues while also offering design and accessibility feedback. This continued beyond launch for about a month, watching streams and reporting new issues found in the field. The team was fantastic to work with, Finji was very supportive, and the project was excellent all-round. I still really enjoy the game and the story it tells, and I'm very proud of my contributions. I also spent some time late in development practicing my speeduns of the game - I'd spent a lot of time playing the game very quickly, both for recursion testing and also for continuity checking. I ended up holding the World Record speedrun for a few months, in the Any% Glitchless category (complete the game as fast as possible, without glitches).
