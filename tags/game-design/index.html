IPS is an old-school patching format, and the only one that I was aware of from old days of applying translation patches, etc. There have been lots of newer patching formats since then, of course, but I was only vaguely aware of them. So when I was asked if I could make a patch that would make one specific change in Quest 64, I thought of IPS. Searching for info about IPS patches and how I could make them, I found the ZeroSoft spec page for IPS that broke down how a patch is structured: https://zerosoft.zophar.net/ips.php. The important thing this showed me about IPS was that despite not having any fancy features or protections, IPS is extremely simple and (mostly) human-readable. If you open an IPS patch in a hex editor, it consists of this: Records are little chunks of data of variable length, that are made up of 3 parts: IPS can do a couple other things too, but reading that spec was enough for me to realize something a bit silly - this patching format is just a bunch of hexadecimal text. And while I didn't know then how to move data around, I definitely knew how to fiddle with text strings. Having clumsily learned a few different kinds of coding over the years, editing strings was easy. And it turned out that every patch (and every file, or game, or application) is actually just one giant wall of hexadecimal characters, which could be stored as a string. [PATCH1A2A3A025B6BEOF]: the content of an IPS patch that writes two [02] bytes of data [5B 6B] to the patched file starting at an address [1A2A3A]. Might be easier to read if I write it like this: [PATCH][1A2A3A][02][5B6B][EOF]. So this patch changes the byte at 1A2A3A to 5B, and 1A2A3B to 6B. There's more to it than that, to be fair - that patch data I just wrote up there is text, and you can't just rename a text file containing that to .IPS and expect it to work. But you can take a text string like that one, and code a little function in almost any language that makes a binary file that contains that patch data, stored in hex rather than text. And that's an IPS patch. So my randomizer kicked off from there. Once I realized I could just write addresses and data as strings, bash them together with "PATCH" and "EOF", and convert it to a binary file, I was set. Here's an example from the randomizer code to show what I mean: /* Fast Monastery: write 00090002 as new door target ID at 4361A0 */ if (rndFastMonasteryToggle.Checked) { patchstrings.Add("4361A0"); patchstrings.Add("0004"); patchstrings.Add("00090002"); } The code says, if the option "Fast Monastery" is enabled, my big list of patch strings will get three things added: the offset, the size, and that many bytes of data. And that patch will tell the patcher to write the 4 bytes [00 09 00 02] to the file, starting at [4361A0]. Each option enabled in the randomizer menu adds to that giant pile of patch strings. And then at the end, after all the options are processed: /* Patching mode: CREATE IPS PATCH */ if (expModePatchIPS.Checked) { patchbuild += headerHex; for (int ps = 0; ps &lt; patchparts; ps++) /* mash all the patch strings together */ { patchbuild += patchstrings[ps]; } patchbuild += footerHex; } patcharray = StringToByteArray(patchbuild, true); /* convert the string to a bytearray */ File.WriteAllBytes(filePath + fileName + ".ips", patcharray); /* write the bytearray to an ips file */ This function makes one big string, that contains IPS header, all the offset/size/data triplets in order, and IPS footer, and converts that string to a ByteArray, which turns it from hex text to hex binary data. It's kind of a simple brute-force method with no error checking, but it works, which is the most important thing. Here's the StringToByteArray function, just for reference: /* Convert hex string to byte array */ public static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex, bool addZero) { int NumberChars = hex.Length; /* Add a leading zero to odd-length hex */ if (NumberChars % 2 != 0) { hex = "0" + hex; NumberChars++; } byte[] bytes = new byte[NumberChars / 2]; /* Fill the byte array, two hex characters at a time */ for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumberChars; i += 2) { bytes[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16); } return bytes; } To be continued.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/miscellaneous-games/">Miscellaneous: Games</a></h2></header><p>Here is a list of my small projects, mostly hosted on itch, although some are currently unavailable. Aleph was a gift in a Bitsy Secret Santa jam, with the requested theme of 'Pokemon'. Keeping the limitations of Bitsy in mind, I tried to write a very brief show-don't-tell story about a bit of history in my favourite Pokemon game and region: Gold/Silver. Link: hangedman.itch.io/aleph Pursuits was a project to practice tabletop manual design and refamiliarize myself with a few different tools, made for the A Game By Its Cover jam. It's effectively a game of tag played on a field of standard playing cards. Link: hangedman.itch.io/pursuits Sanzenri is an active idle game, inspired by Desert Bus and the works of legendary Haiku poet Matsuo Basho. To play the game, the player must press left and right to move their feet forward, and traverse the entire length of Basho's pilgrimage in real-time, with the poems appearing in each region that they were written. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sanzenri Sonder is a Bitsy game where my goal was to write as many different naturalistic responses to the same scene as I could, trying to imagine the thoughts and shouted words of all the different people in a club, as one passes by. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sonder Vision was a long-term project of mine, an attempt to create a somewhat nonlinear narrative action game, to Game Boy specifications. Vision is not currently available, due to the death of Flash. I hope to remake it soon for actual Game Boy hardware.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/gemeton-and-gemeton-arcade/">Gemeton (and Gemeton Arcade)</a></h2></header><p>Gemeton is: A generative fortune-telling toy, a procedural story-telling tool, a daily ritual game, it's something different for everyone. An ongoing long-term project of mine, Gemeton features procedural art, stories, poetry, and fortunes, with the idea of telling a gentle Divine-Comedy-esque story about learning about the mysteries of the universe by wandering the Underworld. I demo'd it live at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, printing fortunes on stickers, and in arcade cabinet form at the Hand Eye Society Ball in Toronto. Development is currently stalled with the need for a rewrite in a more modern engine. It isn't publicly available, but you can read more about it on itch: hangedman.itch.io/gemeton</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/the-dead-prince-and-the-pacifican-express/">The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express</a></h2></header><p>The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express is an unpolished but successful prototype for a procedural murder mystery. In December 2020, I worked with my friend and Rectangles co-organizer Liam Sauvé to take part in the 7DFPS Game Jam, which tasks developers with creating a prototype of a First-Person Shooter game in just seven days. In a previous 7DFPS, I'd tried to execute a concept I created, without much success. It goes like this: The player plays as a vigilante amateur detective, riding on a train with a hidden pistol and a single bullet, intending to find and kill a murderer. The mystery would be random every time, with procedurally generated clues and hints. Before the train arrived at its destination, the player would need to find clues, discuss the event to find inconsistencies, and unmask the killer. It was a good idea, but a bit too ambitious for seven days alone, and so I shelved it for a few years, until Liam got in touch to ask if I wanted to collaborate for 7DFPS. We didn't have any immediate ideas, so I brought the old concept up, and we gave it our best shot. The game gives the player three pieces of evidence left behind by the unknown killer, and their goal is to subtly interrogate the inhabitants of the train by using what information they know about them to judge how they might react. It's extremely difficult, for a lot of reasons, but the concept is solid. Though our project was unpolished and unfinished, we managed to execute on all of our ideas, and learn a lot; a complete success in my book. Liam implemented a smooth interaction system and positional audio, and I created a semi-procedural mystery generator and developed a simple workflow that allowed me to bash out good-looking 3D assets for prototypes.
