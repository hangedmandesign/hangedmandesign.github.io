Aleph was a gift in a Bitsy Secret Santa jam, with the requested theme of 'Pokemon'. Keeping the limitations of Bitsy in mind, I tried to write a very brief show-don't-tell story about a bit of history in my favourite Pokemon game and region: Gold/Silver. Link: hangedman.itch.io/aleph Pursuits was a project to practice tabletop manual design and refamiliarize myself with a few different tools, made for the A Game By Its Cover jam. It's effectively a game of tag played on a field of standard playing cards. Link: hangedman.itch.io/pursuits Sanzenri is an active idle game, inspired by Desert Bus and the works of legendary Haiku poet Matsuo Basho. To play the game, the player must press left and right to move their feet forward, and traverse the entire length of Basho's pilgrimage in real-time, with the poems appearing in each region that they were written. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sanzenri Sonder is a Bitsy game where my goal was to write as many different naturalistic responses to the same scene as I could, trying to imagine the thoughts and shouted words of all the different people in a club, as one passes by. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sonder Vision was a long-term project of mine, an attempt to create a somewhat nonlinear narrative action game, to Game Boy specifications. Vision is not currently available, due to the death of Flash. I hope to remake it soon for actual Game Boy hardware.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/gemeton-and-gemeton-arcade/">Gemeton (and Gemeton Arcade)</a></h2></header><p>Gemeton is: A generative fortune-telling toy, a procedural story-telling tool, a daily ritual game, it's something different for everyone. An ongoing long-term project of mine, Gemeton features procedural art, stories, poetry, and fortunes, with the idea of telling a gentle Divine-Comedy-esque story about learning about the mysteries of the universe by wandering the Underworld. I demo'd it live at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, printing fortunes on stickers, and in arcade cabinet form at the Hand Eye Society Ball in Toronto. Development is currently stalled with the need for a rewrite in a more modern engine. It isn't publicly available, but you can read more about it on itch: hangedman.itch.io/gemeton</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/the-dead-prince-and-the-pacifican-express/">The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express</a></h2></header><p>The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express is an unpolished but successful prototype for a procedural murder mystery. In December 2020, I worked with my friend and Rectangles co-organizer Liam Sauvé to take part in the 7DFPS Game Jam, which tasks developers with creating a prototype of a First-Person Shooter game in just seven days. In a previous 7DFPS, I'd tried to execute a concept I created, without much success. It goes like this: The player plays as a vigilante amateur detective, riding on a train with a hidden pistol and a single bullet, intending to find and kill a murderer. The mystery would be random every time, with procedurally generated clues and hints. Before the train arrived at its destination, the player would need to find clues, discuss the event to find inconsistencies, and unmask the killer. It was a good idea, but a bit too ambitious for seven days alone, and so I shelved it for a few years, until Liam got in touch to ask if I wanted to collaborate for 7DFPS. We didn't have any immediate ideas, so I brought the old concept up, and we gave it our best shot. The game gives the player three pieces of evidence left behind by the unknown killer, and their goal is to subtly interrogate the inhabitants of the train by using what information they know about them to judge how they might react. It's extremely difficult, for a lot of reasons, but the concept is solid. Though our project was unpolished and unfinished, we managed to execute on all of our ideas, and learn a lot; a complete success in my book. Liam implemented a smooth interaction system and positional audio, and I created a semi-procedural mystery generator and developed a simple workflow that allowed me to bash out good-looking 3D assets for prototypes.

I developed it to randomize Quest 64, a 1998 RPG for the Nintendo 64, and it offers many randomization, difficulty modification, and quality-of-life options. Merrow began as an experiment in exploring retro game data structures. I greatly enjoyed Quest 64 as a kid, despite its many flaws, and was curious about romhacking in general. Quest turned out to be an ideal candidate for this, as the game had undergone a long development and tried to implement many unique design concepts, although the execution of those ideas wasn't always the best. Through my research into the game's data, I learned a great deal about how older games were architectured, but also discovered exactly how unfinished Quest really was, as it was rushed out to avoid competing with the seminal N64 title Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I realized that I could use my existing programming skills to write and export simple game patches using an old open-source patching format called IPS, that was designed to be a one-step process to apply wide-ranging edits to a file's hexadecimal data. The first few versions of Merrow were developed in Unity C#, but adding more features required more complex UI improvements, so I migrated the tool to Winforms C# to make it more lightweight. Merrow also ended up containing several other features: My goals throughout the project were usability and clarity, for both the tool and the patched game, reasoning that a game this obscure (with a reputation this bad) would be a hard sell. So by devising many quality-of-life improvements to go alongside my randomization features, I could hopefully make Merrow a revival project of sorts, to bring new players and old to a game I appreciated. I formally 'released' Merrow with version 44, creating several media pieces (including a built-in Help function, explanatory detail sheets and a PDF Guide.)
