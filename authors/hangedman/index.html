Aleph was a gift in a Bitsy Secret Santa jam, with the requested theme of 'Pokemon'. Keeping the limitations of Bitsy in mind, I tried to write a very brief show-don't-tell story about a bit of history in my favourite Pokemon game and region: Gold/Silver. Link: hangedman.itch.io/aleph Pursuits was a project to practice tabletop manual design and refamiliarize myself with a few different tools, made for the A Game By Its Cover jam. It's effectively a game of tag played on a field of standard playing cards. Link: hangedman.itch.io/pursuits Sanzenri is an active idle game, inspired by Desert Bus and the works of legendary Haiku poet Matsuo Basho. To play the game, the player must press left and right to move their feet forward, and traverse the entire length of Basho's pilgrimage in real-time, with the poems appearing in each region that they were written. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sanzenri Sonder is a Bitsy game where my goal was to write as many different naturalistic responses to the same scene as I could, trying to imagine the thoughts and shouted words of all the different people in a club, as one passes by. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sonder Vision was a long-term project of mine, an attempt to create a somewhat nonlinear narrative action game, to Game Boy specifications. Vision is not currently available, due to the death of Flash. I hope to remake it soon for actual Game Boy hardware.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/front/">HANGEDMAN</a></h2></header><p>Jonah Davidson, also known as "Hangedman" is: a game designer and developer, a QA technician and "axeman", a technical and creative writer, a community organizer and advocate, a logo/icon and graphic designer, a speaker and voice actor, and an eternal apprentice.

Originally developed as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod by a team of volunteers (including designers from WETA Workshop, and multimedia artist PU5HB4K), the team would spend a few years migrating their work to Source so it could be enjoyed by more players. I wrote the manual for it. I noticed how much time was spent trying to onboard new players. I wanted to see it reach a wider audience, and I found myself explaining the game's subtler mechanics over and over. So I decided to write a guide. I did some testing and some reverse-engineering, drafted up a short manual block, and posted it on the forums to get some feedback. The response was excellent, and I received and integrated a ton of great feedback, refining it down to focus on beginners. This was my first technical writing project, and it put all my skills to use and sparked something I hadn't expected. The game was available in beta for a long time with a small-but-dedicated community of testers. Ultimately, the game was not accepted onto Steam for a long time, which caused it to stumble in finding a wider audience, but it still has a cult following to this day.

An ongoing long-term project of mine, Gemeton features procedural art, stories, poetry, and fortunes, telling a gentle Divine-Comedy-esque story about learning about the mysteries of the universe. I demo'd it live at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, printing fortunes on stickers, and in arcade cabinet form at the Hand Eye Society Ball in Toronto. It isn't publicly available, but you can read more about it on itch: hangedman.itch.io/gemeton</p></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/authors/hangedman/page/2/" class="btn">Previous</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Content Copyright (C) Hangedman Design 2021.<br>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a>.</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
