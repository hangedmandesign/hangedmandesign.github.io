Act and learn deliberately. Concentration, not attrition. You will only notice your mastery once you have already attained it, when you have long since stopped caring about mastery. The same is true of style, and of wisdom. Progression, not desperation. Never confuse the concept of the craft for the craft itself. The most skilled carpenter still spends most of their time cutting wood. Pragmatism, not romanticism. You will inevitably compare your work against others, so do what only you might do; you cannot do otherwise. Do what others do only to learn why they do it. Improvisation, not juxtaposition. You cannot make mistakes when learning; making mistakes is learning. If you cannot learn to enjoy imperfection, you will never come remotely close to perfection. Experimentation, not resignation. &lt; BACK</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/axeman-ethos/">Axeman Ethos</a></h2></header><p>A "hatchet man" is someone who is called in to do something that no one wants to do, without care or attachment.

It featured audio by A Shell In The Pit (Untitled Goose Game, Rogue Legacy) along with a soundtrack comprised of many varied artists. It was published by Finji (Overland, Night In The Woods) and released on PC, Switch, and Sony platforms on August 25, 2022. Not long after TUNIC released, Finji immediately moved me into spearheading the final major QA pass for Exocolonist, my first project as a QA Lead. The game had already been heavily beta-tested by a dedicated and supportive community, so my goal was to work from that foundation and ensure that a game so focused on inclusivity and expression would be accessible and fun for everyone. My QA process focused very heavily on interaction and controls, overseeing a complete Gamepad implementation, refining UI navigation and comprehension (especially on small screens), and a continuous iterative process of tiny tweaks with outsize impacts. When a player's only methods of interaction with a game are simple, any flaws or frustrations will multiply very quickly, so the most basic interactions (clicking buttons, navigating lists of options, etc.) needed to be perfect. The game is a genre-spanning interactive story, very complex and deeply systematic, rigorously-designed to account for an absurd number of branching story events. It also deals with heavy topics in a very respectful way, but pulls no punches. It is very unique. I was able to offer some insights to Finji on how to meet the expectations of the various crossover audiences who might want to try the game: fans of visual novels, life simulations, colony simulations, character-driven role-playing games, digital card-puzzle games, and more. It's many games in one. Testing Exocolonist was very different than any project I've worked on before, and a very fulfilling challenge. I'm especially proud of the game immediately passing certification across all platforms, an achievement in itself and a testament to the QA team's immaculate work.

Featuring music by Lifeformed (Dustforce, Double Fine Adventure) and audio by Kevin Regamey (Powerup Audio), it was a multi-year project that was finally released on PC and Xbox platforms on March 2022. After my work on Chicory, I was brought on again to assist the excellent Finji QA team as primary PC QA for TUNIC. Our team was embedded alongside the development team, and helped bring the project to completion by ensuring the last few months of development ran smoothly, as well as being a fresh set of eyes on the game's mysteries: acting as advocates for future players. I spent several months testing and experimenting with the game, reporting bugs and issues, offering design and accessibility feedback, and doing my best to support the team on their final sprint to release. I continued to work with the team beyond launch, monitoring and tracking incoming issues; reporting, reproducing, and helping to resolve the complex issues that arose from a very complex game. Despite the complexity (stemming from the game's many secrets and open-world structure), the project's foundation was absolutely solid, and the development was well-planned and well-executed. Working with Finji's expanded QA team was an excellent supportive experience, and I would happily take any chance to collaborate with them again. I'm still enjoying watching others play the game and discover its mysteries. It was, and is, something incredible to have been a part of.

Aleph was a gift in a Bitsy Secret Santa jam, with the requested theme of 'Pokemon'. Keeping the limitations of Bitsy in mind, I tried to write a very brief show-don't-tell story about a bit of history in my favourite Pokemon game and region: Gold/Silver. Link: hangedman.itch.io/aleph Pursuits was a project to practice tabletop manual design and refamiliarize myself with a few different tools, made for the A Game By Its Cover jam. It's effectively a game of tag played on a field of standard playing cards. Link: hangedman.itch.io/pursuits Sanzenri is an active idle game, inspired by Desert Bus and the works of legendary Haiku poet Matsuo Basho. To play the game, the player must press left and right to move their feet forward, and traverse the entire length of Basho's pilgrimage in real-time, with the poems appearing in each region that they were written. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sanzenri Sonder is a Bitsy game where my goal was to write as many different naturalistic responses to the same scene as I could, trying to imagine the thoughts and shouted words of all the different people in a club, as one passes by. Link: hangedman.itch.io/sonder Vision was a long-term project of mine, an attempt to create a somewhat nonlinear narrative action game, to Game Boy specifications. Vision is not currently available, due to the death of Flash. I hope to remake it soon for actual Game Boy hardware.</p></article><nav class="pagination desc"><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/authors/hangedman/page/2/" class="btn">Previous</a></nav></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Content © Hangedman Design.
