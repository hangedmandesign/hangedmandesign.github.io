IPS is an old-school patching format, and the only one that I was aware of from old days of applying translation patches, etc. There have been lots of newer patching formats since then, of course, but I was only vaguely aware of them. So when I was asked if I could make a patch that would make one specific change in Quest 64, I thought of IPS. Searching for info about IPS patches and how I could make them, I found the ZeroSoft spec page for IPS that broke down how a patch is structured: https://zerosoft.zophar.net/ips.php. The important thing this showed me about IPS was that despite not having any fancy features or protections, IPS is extremely simple and (mostly) human-readable. If you open an IPS patch in a hex editor, it consists of this: Records are little chunks of data of variable length, that are made up of 3 parts: IPS can do a couple other things too, but reading that spec was enough for me to realize something a bit silly - this patching format is just a bunch of hexadecimal text. And while I didn't know then how to move data around, I definitely knew how to fiddle with text strings. Having clumsily learned a few different kinds of coding over the years, editing strings was easy. And it turned out that every patch (and every file, or game, or application) is actually just one giant wall of hexadecimal characters, which could be stored as a string. [PATCH1A2A3A025B6BEOF]: the content of an IPS patch that writes two [02] bytes of data [5B 6B] to the patched file starting at an address [1A2A3A]. Might be easier to read if I write it like this: [PATCH][1A2A3A][02][5B6B][EOF]. So this patch changes the byte at 1A2A3A to 5B, and 1A2A3B to 6B. There's more to it than that, to be fair - that patch data I just wrote up there is text, and you can't just rename a text file containing that to .IPS and expect it to work. But you can take a text string like that one, and code a little function in almost any language that makes a binary file that contains that patch data, stored in hex rather than text. And that's an IPS patch. So my randomizer kicked off from there. Once I realized I could just write addresses and data as strings, bash them together with "PATCH" and "EOF", and convert it to a binary file, I was set. Here's an example from the randomizer code to show what I mean: /* Fast Monastery: write 00090002 as new door target ID at 4361A0 */ if (rndFastMonasteryToggle.Checked) { patchstrings.Add("4361A0"); patchstrings.Add("0004"); patchstrings.Add("00090002"); } The code says, if the option "Fast Monastery" is enabled, my big list of patch strings will get three things added: the offset, the size, and that many bytes of data. And that patch will tell the patcher to write the [04] bytes [00 09 00 02] to the file, starting at [4361A0]. Each option enabled in the randomizer menu like the one above, adds to that giant pile of patch strings. And then at the end, after all the options are processed: /* Patching mode: CREATE IPS PATCH */ if (expModePatchIPS.Checked) { patchbuild += headerHex; for (int ps = 0; ps &lt; patchparts; ps++) /* mash all the patch strings together */ { patchbuild += patchstrings[ps]; } patchbuild += footerHex; } patcharray = StringToByteArray(patchbuild, true); /* convert the string to a bytearray */ File.WriteAllBytes(filePath + fileName + ".ips", patcharray); /* write the bytearray to an ips file */ This function makes one big string, that contains the IPS header, all the offset/size/data triplets in order, and the IPS footer. Then it converts that string to a ByteArray, which turns it from hex text to hex binary. It's kind of a simple brute-force method with no error checking, but it works, which is the most important thing. Here's the StringToByteArray function, just for reference: /* Convert hex string to byte array */ public static byte[] StringToByteArray(string hex, bool addZero) { int NumberChars = hex.Length; /* Add a leading zero to odd-length hex */ if (NumberChars % 2 != 0) { hex = "0" + hex; NumberChars++; } byte[] bytes = new byte[NumberChars / 2]; /* Fill the byte array, two hex characters at a time */ for (int i = 0; i &lt; NumberChars; i += 2) { bytes[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16); } return bytes; } It's all just hex, if you dig deep enough. No matter how complex the game, or app, or file, it's eventually just hex. Once I realized that, the terrible enormity of the goofy stuff I could get away with started to hit me.</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/eternal-apprentice-ethos/">Eternal Apprentice Ethos</a></h2></header><p>You will not become a master at any craft through ten thousand mindless hours, or ten thousand heedless failures.

It featured audio by A Shell In The Pit (Untitled Goose Game, Rogue Legacy) along with a soundtrack comprised of many varied artists. It was published by Finji (Overland, Night In The Woods) and released on PC, Switch, and Sony platforms on August 25, 2022. Not long after TUNIC released, Finji immediately moved me into spearheading the final major QA pass for Exocolonist, my first project as a QA Lead. The game had already been heavily beta-tested by a dedicated and supportive community, so my goal was to work from that foundation and ensure that a game so focused on inclusivity and expression would be accessible and fun for everyone. My QA process focused very heavily on interaction and controls, overseeing a complete Gamepad implementation, refining UI navigation and comprehension (especially on small screens), and a continuous iterative process of tiny tweaks with outsize impacts. When a player's only methods of interaction with a game are simple, any flaws or frustrations will multiply very quickly, so the most basic interactions (clicking buttons, navigating lists of options, etc.) needed to be perfect. The game is a genre-spanning interactive story, very complex and deeply systematic, rigorously-designed to account for an absurd number of branching story events. It also deals with heavy topics in a very respectful way, but pulls no punches. It is very unique. I was able to offer some insights to Finji on how to meet the expectations of the various crossover audiences who might want to try the game: fans of visual novels, life simulations, colony simulations, character-driven role-playing games, digital card-puzzle games, and more. It's many games in one. Testing Exocolonist was very different than any project I've worked on before, and a very fulfilling challenge. I'm especially proud of the game immediately passing certification across all platforms, an achievement in itself and a testament to the QA team's immaculate work.

Featuring music by Lifeformed (Dustforce, Double Fine Adventure) and audio by Kevin Regamey (Powerup Audio), it was a multi-year project that was finally released on PC and Xbox platforms on March 2022. After my work on Chicory, I was brought on again to assist the excellent Finji QA team as primary PC QA for TUNIC. Our team was embedded alongside the development team, and helped bring the project to completion by ensuring the last few months of development ran smoothly, as well as being a fresh set of eyes on the game's mysteries: acting as advocates for future players. I spent several months testing and experimenting with the game, reporting bugs and issues, offering design and accessibility feedback, and doing my best to support the team on their final sprint to release. I continued to work with the team beyond launch, monitoring and tracking incoming issues; reporting, reproducing, and helping to resolve the complex issues that arose from a very complex game. Despite the complexity (stemming from the game's many secrets and open-world structure), the project's foundation was absolutely solid, and the development was well-planned and well-executed. Working with Finji's expanded QA team was an excellent supportive experience, and I would happily take any chance to collaborate with them again. I'm still enjoying watching others play the game and discover its mysteries. It was, and is, something incredible to have been a part of.
