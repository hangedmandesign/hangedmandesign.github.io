Merrow also contains several other features: Merrow began as an experiment in exploring retro game data structures. I greatly enjoyed Quest 64 as a kid, despite many clear issues and flaws, and was curious about romhacking in general. Quest was ideal for this, as it tried to implement many interesting design concepts and big ideas, although the execution of those ideas wasn't always the best. Through my research into the game's data, I learned a great deal about how older games were architectured, but also discovered exactly how unfinished Quest really was, rushed out to meet a holiday deadline ahead of the seminal N64 title Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I realized that I could use my existing programming skills to write and export game patches using an old open-source patching format called IPS, that made simple edits to hexadecimal data. The first few versions of Merrow were developed in Unity C#, but adding more features required more complex UI improvements, so I migrated the tool to Winforms C# to make it more lightweight. My goal throughout the project was usability and clarity, reasoning that a game this obscure with a reputation this bad would be a hard sell. But by devising many quality-of-life improvements to go alongside my randomization features, I could hopefully make Merrow a revival project of sorts, to bring in new players and old. I formally 'released' Merrow with version 44, creating several media pieces (including a built-in Help function, explanatory detail sheets and a PDF Guide.)
