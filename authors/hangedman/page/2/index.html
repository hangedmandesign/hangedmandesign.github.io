An ongoing long-term project of mine, Gemeton features procedural art, stories, poetry, and fortunes, with the idea of telling a gentle Divine-Comedy-esque story about learning about the mysteries of the universe by wandering the Underworld. I demo'd it live at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, printing fortunes on stickers, and in arcade cabinet form at the Hand Eye Society Ball in Toronto. Development is currently stalled with the need for a rewrite in a more modern engine.

In December 2020, I worked with my friend and Rectangles co-organizer Liam Sauvé to take part in the 7DFPS Game Jam, which tasks developers with creating a prototype of a First-Person Shooter game in just seven days. In a previous 7DFPS, I'd tried to execute a concept I created, without much success. It goes like this: The player plays as a vigilante amateur detective, riding on a train with a hidden pistol and a single bullet, intending to find and kill a murderer. The mystery would be random every time, with procedurally generated clues and hints. Before the train arrived at its destination, the player would need to find clues, discuss the event to find inconsistencies, and unmask the killer. It was a good idea, but a bit too ambitious for seven days alone, and so I shelved it for a few years, until Liam got in touch to ask if I wanted to collaborate for 7DFPS. We didn't have any immediate ideas, so I brought the old concept up, and we gave it our best shot. The game gives the player three pieces of evidence left behind by the unknown killer, and their goal is to subtly interrogate the inhabitants of the train by using what information they know about them to judge how they might react. It's extremely difficult, for a lot of reasons, but the concept is solid. Though our project was unpolished and unfinished, we managed to execute on all of our ideas, and learn a lot; a complete success in my book. Liam implemented a smooth interaction system and positional audio, and I created a semi-procedural mystery generator and developed a simple workflow that allowed me to bash out good-looking 3D assets for prototypes.

Merrow also contains several other features: Merrow began as an experiment in exploring retro game data structures. I greatly enjoyed Quest 64 as a kid, despite many clear issues and flaws, and was curious about romhacking in general. Quest was ideal for this, as it tried to implement many interesting design concepts and big ideas, although the execution of those ideas wasn't always the best. Through my research into the game's data, I learned a great deal about how older games were architectured, but also discovered exactly how unfinished Quest really was, rushed out to avoid competing with the seminal N64 title Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I realized that I could use my existing programming skills to write and export game patches using an old open-source patching format called IPS, that made simple edits to hexadecimal data. The first few versions of Merrow were developed in Unity C#, but adding more features required more complex UI improvements, so I migrated the tool to Winforms C# to make it more lightweight. My goal throughout the project was usability and clarity, reasoning that a game this obscure with a reputation this bad would be a hard sell. But by devising many quality-of-life improvements to go alongside my randomization features, I could hopefully make Merrow a revival project of sorts, to bring in new players and old. I formally 'released' Merrow with version 44, creating several media pieces (including a built-in Help function, explanatory detail sheets and a PDF Guide.)
