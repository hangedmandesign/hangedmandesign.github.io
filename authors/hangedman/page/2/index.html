Originally developed as an Unreal Tournament 2004 modification by a team of volunteers (including designers from WETA Workshop, and multimedia artist PU5HB4K), the team would spend a few years migrating their work to Source so it could be enjoyed by more players. I found the game during early betas and wrote a manual for it, which unintentionally kickstarted my career as a tech writer. I noticed how much time was spent trying to onboard new players, who were often unprepared for the pace and finality of the game's firefights. I wanted to see it reach a wider audience, and I found myself explaining the game's subtler mechanics over and over. So I decided to write a guide. I did some testing and some reverse-engineering, drafted up a short manual block, and posted it on the forums to get some feedback. The response was excellent, and I received and integrated a ton of great feedback, refining it down to focus on beginners. The team then hosted the guide on the main Neotokyo site. The game was available in beta for a long time with a small-but-dedicated community of testers. Ultimately, the game was not accepted onto Steam for a long time, which caused it to stumble in finding a wider audience, but it still has a cult following to this day. This was my first technical writing project, and it put all my skills to use and sparked something I hadn't expected.

An ongoing long-term project of mine, Gemeton features procedural art, stories, poetry, and fortunes, with the idea of telling a gentle Divine-Comedy-esque story about learning about the mysteries of the universe by wandering the Underworld. I demo'd it live at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, printing fortunes on stickers, and in arcade cabinet form at the Hand Eye Society Ball in Toronto. Development is currently stalled with the need for a rewrite in a more modern engine. It isn't publicly available, but you can read more about it on itch: hangedman.itch.io/gemeton</p></article><article class="feed__item"><header><h2><a href="https://www.hangedmandesign.com/the-dead-prince-and-the-pacifican-express/">The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express</a></h2></header><p>The Dead Prince and The Pacifican Express is an unpolished but successful prototype for a procedural murder mystery. In December 2020, I worked with my friend and Rectangles co-organizer Liam Sauvé to take part in the 7DFPS Game Jam, which tasks developers with creating a prototype of a First-Person Shooter game in just seven days. In a previous 7DFPS, I'd tried to execute a concept I created, without much success. It goes like this: The player plays as a vigilante amateur detective, riding on a train with a hidden pistol and a single bullet, intending to find and kill a murderer. The mystery would be random every time, with procedurally generated clues and hints. Before the train arrived at its destination, the player would need to find clues, discuss the event to find inconsistencies, and unmask the killer. It was a good idea, but a bit too ambitious for seven days alone, and so I shelved it for a few years, until Liam got in touch to ask if I wanted to collaborate for 7DFPS. We didn't have any immediate ideas, so I brought the old concept up, and we gave it our best shot. The game gives the player three pieces of evidence left behind by the unknown killer, and their goal is to subtly interrogate the inhabitants of the train by using what information they know about them to judge how they might react. It's extremely difficult, for a lot of reasons, but the concept is solid. Though our project was unpolished and unfinished, we managed to execute on all of our ideas, and learn a lot; a complete success in my book. Liam implemented a smooth interaction system and positional audio, and I created a semi-procedural mystery generator and developed a simple workflow that allowed me to bash out good-looking 3D assets for prototypes.
