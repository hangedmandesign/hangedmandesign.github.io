The talk details the trials, difficulties, and solutions for creating a sustainable game dev community in any city, at different scales from small to metropolitan. Topics covered included: Through my work with Dirty Rectangles, I have spent several years organizing local events and performing outreach and support for other communities. There were many recurring challenges faced by these communities: smaller scenes in smaller cities that are attempting to grow and establish themselves, larger cities with disparate game dev communities that have difficulty organizing events or finding a cohesive mandate. I assembled the considerable insight that we've gained from a decade of working and interfacing with other communities (Toronto, Montreal, New York, Los Angeles, and many more), with the hope of passing on the Rectangles ethos and helping communities become and continue to be sustainable. Following my performance of this talk at Pixelpop Festival in 2018, I had a chance to meet members of many different communities around the US and discuss their individual challenges, and further refine my knowledge in this area. At the Different Games Conference (also in 2018), I performed this talk alongside a similar one about Game Curious Montreal, an event helmed by Montreal and Toronto organizers. We followed it up with an extensive discussion about the challenges and responsibilities of being a community representative. If you are trying to sustain a community in your area and want to discuss any of the topics covered, feel free to get in touch.

It was successfully Kickstarted and picked up by indie publisher Finji. It was released on PC on June 20, 2021. Finji contracted me to assist with QA, once the project was quite far along in production. What started as a short contract became me taking on the role of primary PC QA, working closely alongside the development team through release. Finji's QA team was focused on the Xbox port and console-specific complexities, and I was happy to offer my help. I spent several months testing and retesting the game extensively, reporting bugs/graphical/structural issues while also offering design and accessibility feedback. This continued beyond launch for about a month, watching streams and reporting new issues found in the field. The team was fantastic to work with, Finji was very supportive, and the project was excellent all-round. I still really enjoy the game and the story it tells, and I'm very proud of my contributions. I also spent some time late in development practicing my speeduns of the game - I'd spent a lot of time playing the game very quickly, both for recursion testing and also for continuity checking. I ended up holding the World Record speedrun for a few months, in the Any% Glitchless category (complete the game as fast as possible, without glitches).
