I developed it to randomize Quest 64, a 1998 RPG for the Nintendo 64, and it offers many randomization, difficulty modification, and quality-of-life options. Merrow began as an experiment in exploring retro game data structures. I greatly enjoyed Quest 64 as a kid, despite its many flaws, and was curious about romhacking in general. Quest turned out to be an ideal candidate for this, as the game had undergone a long development and tried to implement many unique design concepts, although the execution of those ideas wasn't always the best. Through my research into the game's data, I learned a great deal about how older games were architectured, but also discovered exactly how unfinished Quest really was, as it was rushed out to avoid competing with the seminal N64 title Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I realized that I could use my existing programming skills to write and export simple game patches using an old open-source patching format called IPS, that was designed to be a one-step process to apply wide-ranging edits to a file's hexadecimal data. The first few versions of Merrow were developed in Unity C#, but adding more features required more complex UI improvements, so I migrated the tool to Winforms C# to make it more lightweight. Merrow also ended up containing several other features: My goals throughout the project were usability and clarity, for both the tool and the patched game, reasoning that a game this obscure (with a reputation this bad) would be a hard sell. So by devising many quality-of-life improvements to go alongside my randomization features, I could hopefully make Merrow a revival project of sorts, to bring new players and old to a game I appreciated. I formally 'released' Merrow with version 44, creating several media pieces (including a built-in Help function, explanatory detail sheets and a PDF Guide.)
